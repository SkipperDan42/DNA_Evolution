This is a rough simulation of DNA replication and production.

This is intended to be used as an educational tool, 
and the main class should be sufficient code for learners to complete.

The simulation generates two chromosomes for each parent, these chromosomes undergo random merging to form two sex chromosomes (one for each parent).
Each of the child chromosomes are randomly generated from these two sex chromosomes.

The simulation will print the DNA of each chromosome and colour code it to demonstrate whether it came from the mother, father, both or neither.

Additionally very simplified genes are included as dictionaries so that the DNA corresponds to human features. 
These features will then be somewhat mixed for the child.

This simulation is intended to demonstrate the difference between between "random mutation" and signal-switching.
Therefore to sets of DNA are created for the child, one using each method.
It can be observed that random mutation produces much more chaotic changes than signal switching, which inherits the parents genes as not every base pair is randomised.

To add an additional degree of randomisation, the program simulates transcription errors, so that some randomness still exists within signal switching.
