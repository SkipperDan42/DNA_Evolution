"""
This is the Random Mutation method of DNA replication.
-   In Random Mutation the replication process reads each base from each of the
    parent chromosomes and randomly selects one as the base for the child 
    chromosome.
-   This can result in very different DNA, as while every base exists in one of
    the parent chromosomes, the genes they make up can now be very different
    to those in the parents.
-   This can result negative mutations (though these are not included in this
    simulation).
-   Random mutation also occurs through Transcription Errors.
